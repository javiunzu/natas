# Natas
Help scripts and writeup for natas challenges hosted by OverTheWire

All scripts have been written in Python 3.6.

## Disclaimer
The primary goal of these repository is showing how to use Python in CTF
challenges. That's why the passwords are not written in the credentials file:
at least try the scripts!

There is a plethora of specialized libraries and frameworks for penetration
testing, but for didactic purposes, we will use only the Python's standard
library.

## Usage
The file natas.json contains the credentials for each level. Scripts
automatically read the correct credentials. As you progress you can write here
the found flags.
Each script can be run on its own, without any dependency.
